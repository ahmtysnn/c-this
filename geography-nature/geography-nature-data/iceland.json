  "description": "Iceland is a Nordic island country between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean, located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between Europe and North America. It is culturally and politically linked with Europe and is the region's westernmost and most sparsely populated country. Its capital and largest city is Reykjavík, which is home to about 36% of the country's roughly 390,000 residents . The official language of the country is Icelandic. Iceland is on a rift between tectonic plates, and its geologic activity includes geysers and frequent volcanic eruptions. The interior consists of a volcanic plateau with sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite being at a latitude just south of the Arctic Circle. Its latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, and most of its islands have a polar climate.",

    "classification": "Iceland has a subpolar oceanic climate near the southern coastal area and tundra inland in the highlands. The island lies in the path of the North Atlantic Current, which makes its climate more temperate than would be expected for its latitude just south of the Arctic Circle. This effect is aided by the Irminger Current, which also helps to moderate the island's temperature. The weather in Iceland is notoriously variable.",
    "description": "Due to climate change, Iceland is experiencing faster glacial retreat, changing vegetation patterns and shifting marine ecosystems. Although Iceland ranks relatively low internationally in absolute greenhouse gas emissions, producing approximately 49 tonnes in 2023, it ranks within the top 25 countries for emissions per person. Iceland’s main energy sources are geothermal and hydropower, with fossil fuels mostly utilized in the transport sector. Iceland has committed to reaching carbon neutrality before 2040. 750 square kilometers of Iceland’s glacier ice has melted since the year 2000. Iceland’s annual CO2 emissions and per capita CO2 emissions rose from 1950 to 2018, but both metrics have been on the decline since 2018. A majority of Iceland’s CO2 emissions come from oil.",

The unique qualities of Vatnajökull National Park are primarily its great variety of landscape features, created by the combined forces of rivers, glacial ice, and volcanic and geothermal activity. The park spans 14% of the country's area and is Europe's second largest national park in terms of area after Yugyd Va in the Ural Mountains of Russia.
