    "description": "Climatic statistics cited in this article are for the period 1982-2012 and may become inaccurate in the future because of climate change and global warming. Average annual temperatures rose by 1 °C from 1960 until 2016 and are predicted to increase by an additional 2 to 3 °C by 2065. Sea level is projected to rise by 50 cm by 2100. Extreme weather events, including drought and flood, are anticipated to become more frequent. The most immediately visible problem of climatic change in Peru is the melting of glaciers in the Andes. Peru is home to 71 percent of the world's tropical glaciers and since 1970 glacial volume has decreased by 40 percent. Many areas of Peru depend upon glacial melt for water for consumption, irrigation, and industry. In the Cordillera Blanca, for example, glacial melt provides 80 percent of water in the rivers during the dry season and 4-8 percent during the rainy season. The consequence of increased glacial melt is flood",
