This remote archipelago consists of the Kerguelen Islands, Crozet Islands, and Île de la Réunion (the latter often considered separately but historically part of the TAAF).  Characterized by a harsh, subantarctic climate and a unique, isolated ecosystem, the TAAF are a vital area for scientific research and conservation.  The population is extremely small, primarily consisting of researchers, support staff, and a few indigenous inhabitants descended from shipwrecked sailors and sealers.",
