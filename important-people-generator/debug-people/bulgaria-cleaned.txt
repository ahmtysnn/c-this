      "background": "Dimitar Blagoev was born in Zagorichani, a village in Ottoman Macedonia (present-day Greece), to a poor peasant family. His early life was marked by hardship and exposure to the social inequalities of the time. He received a primary education in his village and later studied in Russia, where he was profoundly influenced by the ideas of Russian revolutionary democrats and Marxists. While in Russia, he became involved in revolutionary circles and founded the first social democratic group in Russia in 1883. Upon his return to Bulgaria, he dedicated his life to organizing the nascent workers' movement and spreading socialist ideology. His experiences with poverty and his intellectual development in Russia shaped his unwavering commitment to social justice and the establishment of a socialist society in Bulgaria.",
