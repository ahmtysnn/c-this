His family background was modest, though he was said to be descended from the royal house of Shang. Early in his life, he held minor government positions, which gave him insight into the workings of governance and the challenges facing society. These experiences, coupled with his deep study of ancient rites and music, shaped his conviction that a return to traditional values and ethical conduct was essential for societal harmony. He became a traveling teacher, attracting a loyal following of disciples whom he instructed in principles of morality, governance, and social order. His teachings emphasized humanity, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness, forming the bedrock of what would become Confucianism. His dedication to education and his belief in the transformative power of moral leadership defined his early life and laid the foundation for his enduring philosophical system. He sought to influence rulers with his ideas but largely failed to gain significant political office, spending much of his later life teaching and compiling classical texts.",
