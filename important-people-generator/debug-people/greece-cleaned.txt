      "significance": "Metaxas was a dictator who led Greece into World War II with a heroic \"Ohi,\" but suppressed democratic freedoms.",
      "culturalImpact": "The \"Ohi\" Day (October 28) is a major national holiday in Greece, celebrating Greek resistance and courage against overwhelming odds, a legacy that often overshadows his dictatorial rule. His regime's symbols, propaganda, and social programs are still subjects of historical study, reflecting a complex period of state-building and ideological control. His figure is central to debates about Greek nationalism, authoritarianism, and the complex, often contradictory, memory of World War II in Greece.\n\nMetaxas's leadership during the Italian invasion instilled a sense of national pride and defiance that continues to resonate in Greek collective memory. However, his suppression of democratic freedoms and his authoritarian policies remain a stark reminder of the dangers of dictatorial rule. His cultural impact is thus dual-edged, celebrated for national defense while condemned for his political methods, reflecting the nuanced historical consciousness of the nation.",
