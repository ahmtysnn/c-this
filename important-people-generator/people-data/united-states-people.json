His leadership during this conflict, particularly his role in Braddock’s ill-fated expedition and his subsequent command of Virginia’s frontier forces, honed his strategic thinking and resilience. These formative experiences instilled in him a deep understanding of military logistics and the challenges of command, preparing him for future national leadership.
